## Class Environment

Each class has a sibling with the same name and a "m" at start. The "m" indicates this is a manager for the class(see about factory design pattern).

I use session to manage almost everything. From what page user is coming even what page he'll go. For that I've a view folder that contains some view files(i.e. create.php to show a screen where the user can register a new password). I don't use MVC.

I won't do the hash like a pro 'cause this project is just to practice.
