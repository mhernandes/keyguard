# KeyGuard
This is a basic password manager. I created that just for practice.

I didn't create a edit-user-page because this isn't for multi-users, just for one. I also didn't create a lot of things because this is just for practice PHP development and not for selling or whatever.

I separated password insertion and (en/de)coding in two classes, so you can use any type of encode/hash/whatever you wanna use.
